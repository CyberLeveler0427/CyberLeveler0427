## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am new to coding and trying to figure all of this out, any tips are greatly appreciated. I am currently making a website to share my creative writing. 
I'm really looking for any help on how to create a retro style video game website, or some kinda cool terminal retro feel for the website.
I love writing so I am looking for it to just be a library of my dreams.
